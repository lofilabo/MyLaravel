***You need a file, .env , to run your database and application.

***The root of this file is stores as BACKUP.env

***COPY BACKUP.env ==> .env    and copy it one-level-above this!!

Remember, we want a file called .env one level above this,
in the / of the applications.

for convenience and visbility, we store them as SOMETHING.env

But, your application will require a .env in its root directory.
